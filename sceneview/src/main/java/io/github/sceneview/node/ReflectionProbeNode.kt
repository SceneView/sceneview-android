/**
 * A composable that overrides the scene's indirect light (IBL) with a baked environment
 * for a defined zone around a world-space position.
 *
 * When [radius] is greater than zero, the probe is a local zone: the override only applies
 * while [cameraPosition] is within [radius] metres of [position]. Set [radius] to `0f` (or
 * any non-positive value) for a global probe that always overrides the scene IBL.
 *
 * Multiple `ReflectionProbeNode`s can be declared inside the same `Scene { }` block. The
 * **last** one whose zone contains the camera wins, following Compose's top-down composition
 * order. Use the [priority] parameter to break ties explicitly — the probe with the highest
 * priority value takes precedence when more than one zone is active simultaneously.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * ```kotlin
 * val environment = rememberEnvironment(environmentLoader) {
 *     environmentLoader.createHDREnvironment("environments/office.hdr")!!
 * }
 *
 * Scene(
 *     environment = defaultEnvironment,
 *     onFrame = { cameraPosition = cameraNode.worldPosition }
 * ) {
 *     // Global fallback — always active
 *     ReflectionProbeNode(
 *         filamentScene = scene,
 *         environment = environment,
 *         cameraPosition = cameraPosition
 *     )
 *
 *     // Local zone — active only when the camera is within 3 m of the origin
 *     ReflectionProbeNode(
 *         filamentScene = scene,
 *         environment = officeEnvironment,
 *         position = Position(x = 0f, y = 1f, z = 0f),
 *         radius = 3f,
 *         cameraPosition = cameraPosition
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param filamentScene  The Filament [Scene] whose [Scene.setIndirectLight] is overridden.
 *                       Obtain via [rememberScene] or the `scene` parameter of `Scene { }`.
 * @param environment    The [Environment] containing the [IndirectLight] to apply.
 * @param position       Centre of the reflection zone in world space. Defaults to the origin.
 * @param radius         Sphere radius (metres) of the zone influence. `0f` or negative means
 *                       the probe is always active (global).
 * @param priority       Higher value wins when multiple probes are simultaneously active.
 *                       Has no effect when only one probe is active.
 * @param cameraPosition Current camera world-space position, updated each frame. Drive this
 *                       from `onFrame` via [CameraNode.worldPosition].
