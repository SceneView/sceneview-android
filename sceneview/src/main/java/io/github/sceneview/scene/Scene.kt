/**
 *
 * ### Defines the lighting environment and the skybox of the scene
 *
 * Environments are usually captured as high-resolution HDR equirectangular images and processed by
 * the cmgen tool to generate the data needed by IndirectLight.
 *
 * You can also process an hdr at runtime but this is more consuming.
 *
 * - Currently IndirectLight is intended to be used for "distant probes", that is, to represent
 * global illumination from a distant (i.e. at infinity) environment, such as the sky or distant
 * mountains.
 * Only a single IndirectLight can be used in a Scene. This limitation will be lifted in the future.
 *
 * - When added to a Scene, the Skybox fills all untouched pixels.
 *
 * @return the created directional light

 * @see [KTXLoader.loadEnvironment]
