# /sync-check — Verify SceneView repo synchronization

Run this **before every PR**, at the **end of every session**, and whenever the user asks "where are we" or "is everything ok".

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never tell the user "everything is synced" or "we're good" without running ALL checks below first. Local file versions mean NOTHING if the packages aren't published.

---

## 1. Published packages vs local (MOST CRITICAL)

Check what's actually published and available to developers RIGHT NOW:

```bash
# Maven Central — what devs actually get with implementation("io.github.sceneview:sceneview:X.Y.Z")
for artifact in sceneview arsceneview sceneview-core; do
  V=$(curl -s "https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select?q=g:io.github.sceneview+AND+a:$artifact&rows=1&wt=json" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['response']['docs'][0]['latestVersion'] if d['response']['docs'] else 'NOT FOUND')" 2>/dev/null)
  echo "  Maven $artifact: $V"
done

# npm — what devs get with npx sceneview-mcp
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/sceneview-mcp/latest" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print('  npm sceneview-mcp:', json.load(sys.stdin).get('version','NOT FOUND'))"

# npm sceneview-web
curl -s "https://registry.npmjs.org/@sceneview/sceneview-web/latest" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print('  npm sceneview-web:', json.load(sys.stdin).get('version','NOT FOUND'))" 2>/dev/null || echo "  npm sceneview-web: NOT FOUND"

# GitHub tags — what SPM users get
git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail -1
```

Compare each published version with the local VERSION_NAME. If they don't match:
- **ALERT**: "Version X.Y.Z is NOT published. Developers cannot install it."
- Check if a release workflow ran: `gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 3`
- Check if it succeeded or failed

**This check is a hard blocker. Do NOT skip it.**

## 2. Local version alignment (run the script)

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/sync-versions.sh
```

This checks ALL 30+ version locations:
- `gradle.properties` (root — source of truth)
- `sceneview/gradle.properties`, `arsceneview/gradle.properties`, `sceneview-core/gradle.properties`
- `mcp/package.json`
- `sceneview-web/package.json`
- `react-native/react-native-sceneview/package.json`
- `flutter/sceneview_flutter/pubspec.yaml`
- `flutter/sceneview_flutter/android/build.gradle`
- `flutter/sceneview_flutter/ios/sceneview_flutter.podspec`
- `llms.txt`
- `CLAUDE.md` code examples
- `README.md` install snippets
- `CHANGELOG.md` latest entry
- `sceneview/Module.md`, `arsceneview/Module.md`
- `docs/docs/index.md`, `docs/docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/docs/llms-full.txt`
- `docs/docs/cheatsheet.md`, `docs/docs/platforms.md`
- `website-static/index.html` (softwareVersion + badge + code snippets)
- `sceneview.github.io/index.html` (deployed website)
- `samples/android-demo/build.gradle` versionName
- `mcp/src/index.ts` and `mcp/dist/index.js` version strings

Report any mismatches with: file, current value, expected value.

## 3. Release workflow health

```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 5
```

- Did the last release succeed?
- If it failed, what job failed? (Maven Central, npm, Dokka, GitHub Release)
- Is there a pending tag that wasn't released?

## 4. MCP dist freshness

Compare version strings between `mcp/src/index.ts` and `mcp/dist/index.js`.
If versions differ, run `cd mcp && npm run prepare` and report what changed.

## 5. llms.txt vs Swift source

For each Swift file in `SceneViewSwift/Sources/SceneViewSwift/`:
- Check that the node/struct is documented in the iOS section of `llms.txt`
- Verify the documented signature matches the actual public API

Report any undocumented nodes or signature mismatches.

## 6. llms.txt vs Kotlin source

Check if any new `@Composable` functions or public node classes were added since the last tag:
```bash
LAST_TAG=$(git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail -1)
git diff $LAST_TAG..HEAD -- sceneview/src/ arsceneview/src/ | grep "^+.*fun \|^+.*@Composable\|^+.*class.*Node"
```
If new APIs exist, flag them as needing llms.txt documentation.

## 7. Cross-platform API parity

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/cross-platform-check.sh
```

Report which node types exist on Android but not iOS/Web, and vice versa.

## 8. Docs site deployment

- Check if docs workflow succeeded: `gh run list --workflow=docs.yml --limit 3`
- Is the site accessible? `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://sceneview.github.io/`
- Do the versions on the live site match the current version?

## 9. CLAUDE.md freshness

- Is the "Active branch" correct? (compare with `git branch --show-current`)
- Is the "last updated" date today or recent?
- Does the "Current state" summary match reality?

## 10. Build artifacts check

- Are there any tracked build artifacts? `git ls-files -- '*.o' '*.pcm' '*.swiftmodule' '*.class' 'build.db'`
- Are `SceneViewSwift/.build/`, `docs/.cache/`, `docs/site/` in `.gitignore`?

## 11. Stale branches

```bash
git branch -a --no-merged main
```
Flag any branches older than 7 days that haven't been merged.

## 12. Stale worktrees

```bash
ls -la .claude/worktrees/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```
If more than 5 worktrees, suggest cleanup.

## 13. Summary

Print a table:

| Check | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Maven Central published | OK/FAIL | published: X.Y.Z, local: X.Y.Z |
| npm sceneview-mcp published | OK/FAIL | published: X.Y.Z, local: X.Y.Z |
| npm sceneview-web published | OK/FAIL | published: X.Y.Z, local: X.Y.Z |
| SPM tag exists | OK/FAIL | latest tag: vX.Y.Z |
| Release workflow | OK/FAIL | last run: success/failure |
| Local versions aligned (30+ files) | OK/FAIL | ... |
| Module gradle.properties | OK/FAIL | ... |
| Flutter pubspec+podspec+build.gradle | OK/FAIL | ... |
| React Native package.json | OK/FAIL | ... |
| Website version | OK/FAIL | ... |
| MCP dist fresh | OK/FAIL | ... |
| llms.txt iOS | OK/FAIL | ... |

| Docs site deployed | OK/FAIL | ... |
| CLAUDE.md | OK/FAIL | ... |
| No build artifacts | OK/FAIL | ... |
| No stale branches | OK/FAIL | ... |

**If ANY check fails, do NOT tell the user "everything is good". List every failure clearly and propose fixes.**
