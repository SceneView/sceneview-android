## Previous sessions
- Session 13: Website landing page full redesign via Stitch, Visual QA complete

### 1. Website full redesign via Google Stitch (Phase 1 — Website ✅)
- Created Stitch design system from DESIGN.md tokens (primary #1a73e8, secondary #5b3cc4, tertiary #d97757)
- Generated landing page screen via `generate_screen_from_text` in Stitch project `8306300374268749650`
- Downloaded Stitch-generated HTML, adapted it to SceneView conventions:
  - Removed Tailwind CDN → pure CSS custom properties from DESIGN.md
  - Removed external image CDN → self-hosted assets
  - Kept sceneview.js/Filament.js for 3D rendering
  - Preserved all SEO meta tags, structured data, OG/Twitter cards
- **`website-static/index.html`** — Full rewrite with Stitch design structure:
  - Hero: version badge, gradient title, subtitle, CTAs, platform icons, 3D model
  - Features: 6-card grid (Declarative 3D, AR Ready, AI-First SDK, Cross-Platform, Native Renderers, Open Source)
  - Code comparison: Kotlin (Compose) vs Swift (SwiftUI) side-by-side
  - Platforms: horizontal scroll cards with status badges
  - Install: Gradle dependency code block
  - Showcase: 3-column grid (Architecture, Healthcare, Retail)
  - CTA: "Start building in 5 minutes" with terminal command
  - Footer: 4-column grid (Product, Community, Legal)
- **`website-static/styles.css`** — Complete rewrite (~1340 lines):
  - All tokens from DESIGN.md as CSS custom properties
  - BEM naming, dark/light mode support
  - Responsive: 1024px, 900px, 768px, 600px, 480px breakpoints
  - M3 Expressive spring animations + Liquid Glass on nav/floating surfaces

### 2. Visual QA — Complete
- Desktop 1440×900: ✅ all sections verified (hero, features, code, platforms, install, showcase, CTA, footer)
- Mobile 375×812: ✅ hamburger nav, stacked cards, full-width CTAs, stacked code blocks
- Light mode: ✅ clean white surfaces, dark code blocks, gradient CTA
- Dark mode: ✅ dark surfaces, glass effects, proper contrast

### 3. Cleanup
- Removed temp `preview-stitch.html` and `/tmp/stitch-landing.html`
- Removed CSS cache buster `?v=stitch2` from index.html

## Previous sessions
- Session 12: Security audit (clean), Stitch MCP fixed, git cleanup
- Session 11: Repo reorganization, version cleanup 3.5.1→3.5.2, DESIGN.md, Stitch config

## DECISIONS MADE
- Website uses M3 Expressive (structure) + Liquid Glass (floating surfaces) — correct for web
- Android demo should use Material 3 Expressive (Compose Material 3)
- iOS demo should use Apple Liquid Glass / HIG (SwiftUI native) — NOT Material Design
- Dark mode hero title: solid white text (gradient text invisible in dark mode)
- `.mcp.json` must stay gitignored (contains local paths)

## CURRENT STATE
- **Active branch**: main
- **Latest release**: v3.5.2 (ALL PUBLISHED — Maven Central + npm + GitHub + Stores)
- **MCP servers**: sceneview-mcp 3.5.4 on npm (32 tools, 1204 tests), 9 MCPs total
- **sceneview-web**: v3.5.2 on npm
- **Website**: sceneview.github.io — M3 Expressive + Liquid Glass redesign deployed
- **Google Stitch**: MCP configured, API key set
- **GitHub orgs**: sceneview, sceneview-tools, mcp-tools-lab

## NEXT STEPS (priority order)

### ✅ BLOCKER RESOLVED — Stitch MCP ready
- `.mcp.json` is in project root, gitignored, config correct
- Wrapper at `~/.claude/stitch-wrapper.sh` tested and working (12 tools)
- **Just start a new Claude Code session** → Stitch tools appear automatically
- Once loaded, ALL visual work goes through Stitch

### Phase 1 — FULL REDESIGN VIA GOOGLE STITCH
Everything visual must be redesigned using Google Stitch as the design tool.
Stitch generates the design → Claude applies it in code. NO manual CSS/UI writing.

1. ~~**Website** (sceneview.github.io) — Full redesign via Stitch~~ ✅ DONE (session 13+14)
   - index.html fully redesigned, QA'd (desktop/mobile/light/dark) — session 13
   - All 7 secondary pages redesigned and deployed — session 14
2. ~~**Android demo app** — Theme via Stitch (M3 Expressive)~~ ✅ DONE (session 14)
   - Color.kt, Theme.kt, Shape.kt, Type.kt — all created with Stitch #005bc1
3. ~~**iOS demo app** — Theme via Stitch (Liquid Glass / Apple HIG)~~ ✅ DONE (session 14)
   - Theme.swift + AccentColor updated, tint aligned
4. ~~**Docs MkDocs** — CSS via Stitch~~ ✅ DONE (session 14)
5. **All other demos** — web-demo, tv-demo, etc.
6. **Store assets** — Screenshots with new design

### Phase 2 — Post-redesign
- v3.6.0 roadmap: API simplification
- sceneview.js enhancements (setQuality, setBloom, addLight)
- iOS: verify SceneViewSwift fixes compile in Xcode

## RULES REMINDER
- **STITCH MANDATORY** — ALL design/UI work goes through Google Stitch MCP. NEVER write CSS/theme by hand.
- ALWAYS save API keys/credentials in `profile-private/preferences/api-keys.md` + `~/.zshrc`
- ALWAYS push `profile-private` after saving sensitive data
- Material 3 Expressive = Android/Web, Liquid Glass = Apple platforms
