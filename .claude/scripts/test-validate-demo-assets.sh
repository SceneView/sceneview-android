# test-validate-demo-assets.sh — self-test for validate-demo-assets.sh
#
# Runs three scenarios:
#   1. A tiny fixture repo where every ref resolves       → expect exit 0
#   2. The same fixture with a broken bundled ref         → expect exit 1
#   3. The real repo in --no-cdn mode                     → expect exit 0
#
# Failure of any scenario means validate-demo-assets.sh is broken
# (either newly buggy or hiding a real regression in samples/).

# Usage: bash .claude/scripts/test-validate-demo-assets.sh
