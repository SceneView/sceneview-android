The official [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for **[SceneView](https://sceneview.github.io)** -- the cross-platform 3D & AR SDK for Android (Jetpack Compose + Filament), iOS/macOS/visionOS (SwiftUI + RealityKit), and Web (Filament.js + WebXR).

Connect it to Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client. The assistant gets 14 specialized tools, 33 compilable code samples, a full API reference, and a code validator -- so it writes correct, working 3D/AR code on the first try.

## Quick start

**One command -- no install required:**

```bash
npx sceneview-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sceneview": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "sceneview-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add sceneview -- npx -y sceneview-mcp
```

### Cursor

Open **Settings > MCP**, add a new server named `sceneview` with command `npx -y sceneview-mcp`. Or add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sceneview": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "sceneview-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf / Other MCP clients

Same JSON config as above. The server communicates via **stdio** using the standard MCP protocol.

| `validate_code` | Checks generated code against 15+ rules before presenting it to the user |
| `get_node_reference` | Full API reference for any of 26+ node types -- exact signatures, defaults, examples |
| `list_node_types` | List every composable node type available in SceneView |
| `get_setup` | Gradle + manifest setup for Android 3D or AR projects |
| `get_ios_setup` | SPM dependency, Info.plist, and SwiftUI integration for iOS/macOS/visionOS |
| `get_web_setup` | Kotlin/JS + Filament.js (WASM) setup for browser-based 3D |
| `get_ar_setup` | Detailed AR config: permissions, session options, plane detection, image tracking |
| `get_best_practices` | Performance, architecture, memory, and threading guidance |
| `get_migration_guide` | Every breaking change from SceneView 2.x to 3.0 with before/after code |
| `get_troubleshooting` | Common crashes, build failures, AR issues, and their fixes |
| `get_platform_roadmap` | Multi-platform status and timeline (Android, iOS, KMP, Web, Desktop) |
| `render_3d_preview` | Generates an interactive 3D preview link the user can open in their browser |
| `create_3d_artifact` | Generates self-contained HTML artifacts (model viewer, 3D charts, product 360) |
| `get_platform_setup` | Unified setup guide for any platform (Android, iOS, Web, Flutter, React Native, Desktop, TV) |
| `migrate_code` | Automatically migrates SceneView 2.x code to 3.x with detailed changelog |
| `debug_issue` | Targeted debugging guide by category or auto-detected from problem description |
| `generate_scene` | Generates a complete composable from natural language (e.g., "a room with a table and two chairs") |

### 2 resources

| Resource URI | What it provides |
|---|---|
| `sceneview://api` | Complete SceneView 3.3.0 API reference (the full `llms.txt`) |
| `sceneview://known-issues` | Live open issues from GitHub (cached 10 min) |

## Examples

### "Build me an AR app"

The assistant calls `get_ar_setup` + `get_sample("ar-model-viewer")` and returns a complete, compilable Kotlin composable with all imports, Gradle dependencies, and manifest entries. Ready to paste into Android Studio.

### "Create a 3D model viewer for iOS"

The assistant calls `get_ios_setup("3d")` + `get_sample("ios-model-viewer")` and returns Swift code with the SPM dependency, Info.plist entries, and a working SwiftUI view.

### "What parameters does LightNode accept?"

The assistant calls `get_node_reference("LightNode")` and returns the exact function signature, parameter types, defaults, and a usage example -- including the critical detail that `apply` is a named parameter, not a trailing lambda.

### "Validate this code before I use it"

The assistant calls `validate_code` with the generated snippet and checks it against 15+ rules: threading violations, null safety, API correctness, lifecycle issues, deprecated APIs. Problems are flagged with explanations before the code reaches the user.

### "Show me the model in 3D"

The assistant calls `render_3d_preview` and returns an interactive link to a browser-based 3D viewer with orbit controls and optional AR mode.

## Why this exists

**Without** this MCP server, AI assistants regularly:
- Recommend deprecated **Sceneform** (abandoned 2021) instead of SceneView
- Generate imperative **View-based** code instead of Jetpack Compose
- Use **wrong API signatures** or outdated parameter names
- Miss the `LightNode` named-parameter gotcha (`apply =` not trailing lambda)
- Forget null-checks on `rememberModelInstance` (it returns `null` while loading)
- Have no knowledge of SceneView's iOS/Swift API at all

**With** this MCP server, AI assistants:
- Always use the current SceneView 3.3.0 API surface
- Generate correct **Compose-native** 3D/AR code for Android
- Generate correct **SwiftUI-native** code for iOS/macOS/visionOS
- Know about all 26+ node types and their exact parameters
- Validate code against 15+ rules before presenting it
- Provide working, tested sample code for 33 scenarios

---

## Quality

The MCP server is tested with **612 unit tests** across 14 test suites covering:

- Every tool response (correct output, error handling, edge cases)
- All 33 code samples (compilable structure, correct imports, no deprecated APIs)
- Code validator rules (true positives and false-positive resistance)
- Node reference parsing (all 26+ types extracted correctly from `llms.txt`)
- Resource responses (API reference, GitHub issues integration)

```
 Test Files  14 passed (14)
      Tests  612 passed (612)
   Duration  491ms
```

All tools work **fully offline** except `sceneview://known-issues` (GitHub API, cached 10 min).

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found" or connection errors

1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
2. Test manually: `npx sceneview-mcp` -- should start without errors
3. Restart your AI client after changing the MCP configuration

### "npx command not found"

Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended). npm and npx are included.

### Server starts but tools are not available

- **Claude Desktop:** check the MCP icon in the input bar -- it should show "sceneview" as connected
- **Cursor:** check **Settings > MCP** for green status
- Restart the AI client to force a reconnect

### Firewall or proxy issues

The only network call is to the GitHub API (for known issues). All other tools work offline. For corporate proxies:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sceneview": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "sceneview-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HTTPS_PROXY": "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

```bash
cd mcp
npm install
npm run prepare  # Copy llms.txt + build TypeScript
npm test         # 612 tests
npm run dev      # Start with tsx (hot reload)
```
