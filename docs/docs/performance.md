# Performance Guide

Ship smooth 60fps 3D and AR experiences on Android. This guide covers profiling,
asset optimization, scene tuning, Compose best practices, and device-tier strategies
for the SceneView SDK.

## Measuring Performance

Before optimizing, measure. Guessing where time is spent leads to wasted effort.

### Frame budget

At 60fps your app has **16.6ms per frame** for everything: CPU logic, GPU rendering,
Compose layout, and ARCore tracking. Anything over that budget causes dropped frames
and visible jank.

!!! info "The 16.6ms rule"
    60fps = 1000ms / 60 = **16.6ms per frame**. That includes CPU work, GPU rendering,
    and any Compose recomposition. Aim for headroom — target **12ms** so spikes don't
    push you over.

### Android Studio Profiler

Use the built-in profiler in Android Studio to identify bottlenecks:

- **CPU Profiler** — look for long `onFrame` or `onSessionUpdated` calls, excessive
  allocations, or blocking I/O on the main thread.
- **GPU Profiler** — check for overdraw (red = 4x overdraw), long fragment shader
  times, or GPU-bound frames.
- **Memory Profiler** — watch for repeated allocations each frame (GC pauses cause
  jank). Look for leaked `ModelInstance` or `Material` objects.

### Filament debug stats

Enable Filament's built-in frame statistics to see draw calls, triangle counts, and
GPU timing without leaving your app:

```kotlin
Scene(
    engine = engine,
    modelLoader = modelLoader,
    // ...
) {
    // Access the Filament view for debug options
}
```

!!! tip "Quick debug overlay"
    Use `adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo <package>` for a quick frame-time histogram
    without any code changes.

---

## Model Optimization

Models are usually the biggest performance lever. A poorly optimized model can
single-handedly destroy your frame rate.

### Polygon count

| Target | Triangle budget |
|---|---|
| Interactive objects | < 100K triangles |
| Hero/showcase models | < 200K triangles (high-end only) |
| Background/environment | < 50K triangles |

!!! warning "Triangles add up fast"
    A single model might be 50K triangles, but if you have 10 in the scene that is
    500K — well beyond mobile budgets. Always count **total scene triangles**.

**Reduction tools:**

- **Blender** — Decimate modifier (collapse or un-subdivide)
- **meshoptimizer** — `meshopt_simplify` for automated LOD generation
- **gltfpack** — CLI tool that simplifies, compresses, and optimizes glTF/GLB files

Use **LOD (Level of Detail)** when available: show high-poly when the camera is close,
swap to low-poly at distance. This can cut triangle count by 50-80% for complex scenes.

### Textures

Textures consume the most GPU memory and bandwidth on mobile.

| Rule | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Format | **KTX2** with Basis Universal compression |
| Max size | **2048x2048** for mobile (1024x1024 for low-end) |
| Mipmaps | Always enable for objects viewed at varying distances |
| Channels | Use single-channel textures for roughness/metallic, not full RGBA |

!!! tip "KTX2 saves memory and load time"
    KTX2 with Basis Universal (ETC1S or UASTC) compresses textures 4-8x compared to
    raw PNG/JPEG, and they stay compressed in GPU memory. Convert with
    `toktx --t2 --bcmp input.png output.ktx2`.

### File size

Smaller files mean faster loading and less memory pressure:

| Target | Size |
|---|---|
| Interactive models | < 10MB |
| Hero/showcase models | < 50MB |
| Quick-load previews | < 2MB |

**Optimization checklist:**

- [x] Use **GLB** (binary glTF) instead of glTF + separate .bin/.png files
- [x] Enable **Draco geometry compression** for mesh data
- [x] Strip unused animations, blend shapes, and extra UV sets
- [x] Run `gltfpack` as a final optimization pass

```bash
# Example: optimize a model with gltfpack
gltfpack -i model.glb -o model_optimized.glb -tc -cc -si 0.5
# -tc = texture compression, -cc = codec compression, -si = simplification ratio
```

## Scene Optimization

### Limit draw calls

Each visible node typically generates one or more draw calls. On mobile, aim for
**fewer than 100 draw calls** per frame.

- **Fewer separate nodes** = fewer draw calls. Merge static geometry in your 3D
  tool before export.
- **Use instancing** for repeated objects (trees, rocks, particles). Filament
  supports GPU instancing for identical meshes.
- **Frustum culling** is automatic in Filament — objects outside the camera view
  are not rendered. But they still cost CPU time if they exist as nodes.

!!! example "Merge before export"
    If you have 50 static building meshes in Blender, join them into one object
    before exporting to GLB. This turns 50 draw calls into 1.

### Lights

Lights are one of the most expensive parts of a scene. Each additional light
increases per-fragment shading cost.

| Light type | Cost | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Directional (sun) | Low | Use 1 as your main light |
| Point / Spot | Medium | Limit to 2-3 total |
| Shadow-casting | High | Limit to 1-2 lights with shadows |

```kotlin
val mainLight = rememberMainLightNode(engine) {
    intensity = 100_000f
    // Shadows on the main light only
}
```

!!! tip "Use IBL instead of many point lights"
    Image-Based Lighting (IBL) from an HDR environment map provides realistic ambient
    lighting at nearly zero per-frame cost. One directional light + IBL covers most
    use cases better than 5+ point lights.

```kotlin
val environment = rememberEnvironment(environmentLoader) {
    createHDREnvironment("environments/studio.hdr")!!
}
```

### Post-processing

Post-processing effects look great but eat into your frame budget:

| Effect | Typical cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bloom | ~1-2ms | Acceptable on mid-tier and above |
| Depth of Field | ~1-2ms | Use sparingly, mainly for screenshots |
| SSAO | ~2-3ms | Most expensive — skip on low-end devices |
| Anti-aliasing (FXAA) | ~0.5ms | Cheap, usually worth enabling |

!!! warning "SSAO on budget devices"
    Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion is the most expensive post-process effect. On
    low-end devices it can take 3ms+ alone — nearly 20% of your frame budget.
    Disable it on devices below your mid-tier threshold.

Enable effects selectively based on device tier (see [Device Tiers](#device-tiers)
below).

## Compose Integration

SceneView is a Jetpack Compose library, so Compose performance rules apply directly.

### Avoid unnecessary recompositions

Recomposition during rendering can cause frame drops. Follow these rules:

```kotlin
// BAD — creates new Position every recomposition, triggering node updates
Scene(/* ... */) {
    ModelNode(
        modelInstance = model,
        position = Position(0f, 1f, 0f)  // new object every recomposition!
    )
}

// GOOD — stable reference, no unnecessary updates
val position = remember { Position(0f, 1f, 0f) }

Scene(/* ... */) {
    ModelNode(
        modelInstance = model,
        position = position
    )
}
```

!!! danger "No allocations in the composition body"
    Never create new `Position`, `Rotation`, `Scale`, or `Quaternion` objects
    directly inside `Scene { }` without `remember`. Each recomposition creates
    a new instance, causing the node to update every frame.

**Key rules:**

- Use `remember` for stable `Position`, `Rotation`, and `Scale` references
- Use `key` on model instances to avoid unnecessary reload when list order changes
- Use `derivedStateOf` when computing values from other state

### Share the Engine

The Filament `Engine` is expensive to create. Never create more than one.

```kotlin
// At the app/activity level
val engine = rememberEngine()
val modelLoader = rememberModelLoader(engine)
val materialLoader = rememberMaterialLoader(engine)
val environmentLoader = rememberEnvironmentLoader(engine)

// Share across all scenes via CompositionLocal or parameter passing
Scene(engine = engine, modelLoader = modelLoader, /* ... */) { }
```

!!! failure "One Engine per app — not per screen"
    Creating multiple `Engine` instances wastes GPU memory and can cause crashes
    on devices with limited resources. Create one at the top level and pass it down.

### Lazy loading

Load models on-demand rather than all at startup:

```kotlin
// rememberModelInstance loads asynchronously and returns null while loading
val model = rememberModelInstance(modelLoader, "models/character.glb")

Scene(/* ... */) {
    if (model != null) {
        ModelNode(modelInstance = model)
    } else {
        // Show a placeholder while loading
        CubeNode(materialInstance = placeholderMaterial)
    }
}
```

- `rememberModelInstance` handles async loading and main-thread marshalling correctly
- Show placeholder geometry (a simple cube or spinner) while the model loads
- For imperative code outside Compose, use `modelLoader.loadModelInstanceAsync`

!!! warning "Threading: Filament calls must be on the main thread"
    Never call `modelLoader.createModel*` or `materialLoader.*` from a background
    coroutine. `rememberModelInstance` handles this automatically. For imperative
    code, use `loadModelInstanceAsync`.

---

## AR-Specific Optimization

AR adds the camera feed and ARCore tracking to your frame budget, leaving less room
for rendering.

### Camera frame processing

`onSessionUpdated` runs **every single frame**. Any work you do here directly
impacts frame rate.

```kotlin
ARScene(
    // ...
    onSessionUpdated = { session, frame ->
        // FAST: read a cached value
        val planes = frame.getUpdatedPlanes()

        // SLOW: don't do this!
        // val bitmap = frame.acquireCameraImage().toBitmap()  // allocation + conversion
    }
)
```

!!! danger "No allocations in onSessionUpdated"
    This callback runs 30-60 times per second. Allocating objects here causes GC
    pressure and frame drops. Cache references outside the callback and reuse them.

**Rules for `onSessionUpdated`:**

- Do not allocate objects (no `listOf`, `map`, `filter` on every frame)
- Cache plane and anchor references outside the callback
- If you need heavy processing (image analysis, ML), dispatch to a background
  thread and read results on the next frame

### Plane rendering

The AR plane renderer draws detected surfaces with a semi-transparent overlay.
This causes **GPU overdraw** — especially problematic when multiple planes overlap.

```kotlin
ARScene(
    planeRenderer = planeRenderer,
    // ...
)

// Disable after the user has placed their object
LaunchedEffect(objectPlaced) {
    if (objectPlaced) {
        planeRenderer.isVisible = false  // reduces overdraw
    }
}
```

!!! tip "Disable planes after placement"
    Once the user has placed an object, disable `planeRenderer`. This removes
    overdraw from plane visualization and saves 1-2ms per frame on most devices.

## Device Tiers

Not all Android devices are equal. Adapt your scene complexity based on hardware
capability.

| Tier | Example devices | Triangle budget | Post-processing | Shadows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **High** | Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung S24, OnePlus 12 | 200K triangles | Full (Bloom, SSAO, DoF) | 2 shadow-casting lights |
| **Mid** | Pixel 6a, Samsung A54, Pixel 7 | 100K triangles | Basic (Bloom only) | 1 shadow-casting light |
| **Low** | Older budget phones, 2GB RAM devices | 50K triangles | None | No shadows |

### Detecting device tier

```kotlin
fun getDeviceTier(context: Context): DeviceTier {
    val activityManager = context.getSystemService(Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE)
        as ActivityManager
    val memInfo = ActivityManager.MemoryInfo()
    activityManager.getMemoryInfo(memInfo)

    val totalRamGb = memInfo.totalMem / (1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0)

    return when {
        totalRamGb >= 8.0 -> DeviceTier.HIGH
        totalRamGb >= 4.0 -> DeviceTier.MID
        else -> DeviceTier.LOW
    }
}

enum class DeviceTier { HIGH, MID, LOW }
```

!!! note "RAM is a proxy, not a guarantee"
    Total RAM is a rough proxy for device capability. For more accurate tiering,
    also consider GPU model (`GLES20.glGetString(GLES20.GL_RENDERER)`), Android
    version, and the [Android Performance Tuner](https://developer.android.com/games/sdk/performance-tuner)
    library.

### Applying tiers

```kotlin
val tier = remember { getDeviceTier(context) }

Scene(
    engine = engine,
    modelLoader = modelLoader,
    // ...
) {
    // Adjust quality based on tier
    val modelPath = when (tier) {
        DeviceTier.HIGH -> "models/character_high.glb"
        DeviceTier.MID -> "models/character_mid.glb"
        DeviceTier.LOW -> "models/character_low.glb"
    }

    val model = rememberModelInstance(modelLoader, modelPath)
    if (model != null) {
        ModelNode(modelInstance = model)
    }
}
```
