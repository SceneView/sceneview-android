# Changelog

## 3.2.0 — Physics, atmosphere, drawing, and text

### New node types

- **`DynamicSkyNode`** — time-of-day sun with colour, intensity, and direction driven by a `Float` hour value. Sunrise/sunset colour model, turbidity control.
- **`FogNode`** — atmospheric fog via Filament `View.fogOptions`. Density, height falloff, and colour driven by Compose state.
- **`ReflectionProbeNode`** — local IBL override. Overrides the scene's indirect light within a spherical zone. Camera-position-aware activation.
- **`PhysicsNode`** — rigid body simulation. Gravity, floor bounce (restitution), collision radius. Wraps any existing node.
- **`LineNode`** — single 3D line segment between two points. GPU line primitive via Filament.
- **`PathNode`** — 3D polyline through a list of points. Supports closed loops and animated geometry updates via `updateGeometry()`.
- **`TextNode`** — camera-facing text label rendered to a Canvas bitmap. Configurable font size, text/background colour.
- **`BillboardNode`** — camera-facing image quad. Always rotates toward the camera.

### New samples

- **`dynamic-sky`** — interactive time-of-day, turbidity, and fog controls
- **`reflection-probe`** — metallic spheres with local cubemap reflections
- **`physics-demo`** — tap-to-throw balls with gravity and bounce
- **`post-processing`** — toggle bloom, depth-of-field, SSAO, and fog
- **`line-path`** — 3D lines, spirals, axis gizmos, animated sine wave
- **`text-labels`** — camera-facing text labels on 3D spheres

### Improvements

- Post-processing pipeline exposed via `View` options (bloom, DoF, SSAO, fog)
- `MeshNode` composable for custom vertex/index buffer geometry
- Filament and ARCore version bumps

## 3.0.0 — Compose-native rewrite

### Breaking changes

The entire public API has been redesigned around Jetpack Compose. There is no source-compatible
upgrade path from 2.x; see the [Migration guide](https://sceneview.github.io/migration/) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

#### `Scene` and `ARScene` — new DSL-first signature

Nodes are no longer passed as a list. They are declared as composable functions inside a
trailing content block:

```kotlin
// 2.x
Scene(
    childNodes = rememberNodes {
        add(ModelNode(modelInstance = loader.createModelInstance("helmet.glb")))
    }
)

// 3.0
Scene {
    rememberModelInstance(modelLoader, "models/helmet.glb")?.let { instance ->
        ModelNode(modelInstance = instance, scaleToUnits = 1.0f)
    }
}
```

#### `SceneScope` — new composable DSL

All node types (`ModelNode`, `LightNode`, `CubeNode`, `SphereNode`, `CylinderNode`, `PlaneNode`,
`ImageNode`, `ViewNode`, `MeshNode`, `Node`) are now `@Composable` functions inside `SceneScope`.
Child nodes are declared in a `NodeScope` trailing lambda, matching how Compose UI nesting works.

#### `ARSceneScope` — new AR composable DSL

All AR node types (`AnchorNode`, `PoseNode`, `HitResultNode`, `AugmentedImageNode`,
`AugmentedFaceNode`, `CloudAnchorNode`, `TrackableNode`, `StreetscapeGeometryNode`) are now
`@Composable` functions inside `ARSceneScope`.

#### `rememberModelInstance` — async, null-while-loading

```kotlin
// Returns null while loading; recomposes with the instance when ready
val instance = rememberModelInstance(modelLoader, "models/helmet.glb")
```

#### `SurfaceType` — new enum

Replaces the previous boolean flag. Controls whether the 3D surface renders behind Compose layers
(`SurfaceType.Surface`, SurfaceView) or inline (`SurfaceType.TextureSurface`, TextureView).

#### `PlaneVisualizer` — converted to Kotlin

`PlaneVisualizer.java` has been removed. `PlaneVisualizer.kt` replaces it.

#### Removed classes

The following legacy Java/Sceneform classes have been removed from the public API:

- All classes under `com.google.ar.sceneform.*` — replaced by Kotlin equivalents under the same
  package path (`.kt` files).
- All classes under `io.github.sceneview.collision.*` — replaced by Kotlin equivalents.
- All classes under `io.github.sceneview.animation.*` — replaced by Kotlin equivalents.

#### Samples restructured

All samples are now pure `ComponentActivity` + `setContent { }`. Fragment-based layouts have been
removed. The `model-viewer-compose`, `camera-manipulator-compose`, and `ar-model-viewer-compose`
modules have been merged into `model-viewer`, `camera-manipulator`, and `ar-model-viewer`
respectively.

### Bug fixes

- **`ModelNode.isEditable`** — `SideEffect` was resetting `isEditable` to the parameter default
  (`false`) on every recomposition, silently disabling gestures when `isEditable = true` was set
  only inside `apply { }`. Pass `isEditable = true` as a named parameter to maintain it correctly.
- **ARCore install dialog** — Removed `canBeInstalled()` pre-check that threw
  `UnavailableDeviceNotCompatibleException` before `requestInstall()` was called, preventing the
  ARCore install prompt from ever appearing on fresh devices.
- **Camera background black** — `ARCameraStream` used `RenderableManager.Builder(4)` with only
  1 geometry primitive defined (invalid in Filament). Fixed to `Builder(1)`.
- **Camera stream recreated on every recomposition** — `rememberARCameraStream` used a default
  lambda parameter as a `remember` key; lambdas produce a new instance on every call, making the
  key unstable. Fixed by keying on `materialLoader` only.
- **Render loop stale camera stream** — The render-loop coroutine captured `cameraStream` at
  launch; recomposition could recreate the stream while the loop kept updating the old (destroyed)
  one. Fixed with an `AtomicReference` updated via `SideEffect`.

### New features

- **`SceneScope` / `ARSceneScope`** — fully declarative, reactive 3D/AR content DSL
- **`NodeScope`** — nested child nodes using Compose's natural trailing lambda pattern
- **`SceneNodeManager`** — internal bridge that syncs Compose snapshot state with the Filament
  scene graph, enabling reactive updates without manual `addChildNode`/`removeChildNode` calls
- **`SurfaceType`** — explicit surface-type selection (`Surface` vs `TextureSurface`)
- **`ViewNode`** — Compose UI content rendered as a 3D plane surface in the scene
- **`Engine.drainFramePipeline()`** — consolidated fence-drain extension for surface resize/destroy
- **`rememberViewNodeManager()`** — lifecycle-safe window manager for `ViewNode` composables
- **Autopilot Demo** — new sample demonstrating autonomous animation and scene composition
- **Camera Manipulator** — new dedicated sample for orbit/pan/zoom camera control
- **`Node.scaleGestureSensitivity`** — new `Float` property (default `0.5`) that damps
  pinch-to-scale gestures. Applied as `1f + (rawFactor − 1f) × sensitivity` in `onScale`,
  making scaling feel progressive without reducing the reachable scale range. Set it per-node in
  the `apply` block alongside `editableScaleRange`.
- **AR Model Viewer sample** — redesigned with animated scanning reticle (corner brackets +
  pulsing ring), model picker (Helmet / Rabbit), auto-dismissing gesture hints,
  `enableEdgeToEdge()`, and a clean Material 3 UI.
