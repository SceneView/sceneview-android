# AI-Assisted Development

SceneView is the first 3D/AR library designed for AI-assisted development. Every API is documented in a machine-readable format that AI tools understand natively.

---

## Why this matters

When you ask an AI to help you build a 3D scene, it needs to know the exact API — function names, parameter types, threading rules, common patterns. Most 3D libraries have large, complex APIs that AI tools hallucinate about.

SceneView solves this with three layers:

1. **`llms.txt`** — a machine-readable API reference at the repo root
2. **`@sceneview/mcp`** — an MCP server that gives AI tools full API context
3. **Claude Code skills** — guided workflows for contributing, reviewing, and documenting

---

## For app developers

### Use with Claude Code

Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), then in your project:

```bash
# Add SceneView MCP server to your project
echo '{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sceneview": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@sceneview/mcp"] }
  }
}' > .claude/mcp.json
```

Now Claude has the full SceneView API. Ask it to:

- "Add a 3D model viewer to my product detail screen"
- "Add AR tap-to-place with pinch-to-scale"
- "Add a dynamic sky with fog that changes based on a slider"
- "Show a loading indicator while the model loads"

The AI will generate correct SceneView code — no hallucinated methods, no outdated patterns.

### Use with Cursor / Windsurf / other editors

Copy `llms.txt` from the SceneView repo into your project root, or add the MCP server to your editor's MCP config. The AI tools will pick it up automatically.

### Use with ChatGPT / Claude web

Paste the contents of [`llms.txt`](https://github.com/sceneview/sceneview/blob/main/llms.txt) into your conversation, then ask your question. The AI will use the correct API.

## For SceneView contributors

### Slash commands

Inside the SceneView repo with Claude Code:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/contribute` | Full guided workflow — understand the codebase, make changes, prepare a PR |
| `/review` | Check threading rules, Compose API patterns, Kotlin style, module boundaries |
| `/document` | Generate/update KDoc for changed public APIs, update `llms.txt` |
| `/test` | Audit test coverage and generate missing tests |

### Example workflow

```bash
cd sceneview
claude

# Then in Claude Code:
> /contribute
# Claude walks you through understanding the codebase,
# making changes, running checks, and preparing a PR.
```

## What's in `llms.txt`

A 500-line, machine-readable API reference covering:

- All composable signatures with parameter types and defaults
- Code examples for every node type
- Threading rules and common pitfalls
- Resource loading patterns
- Gesture and interaction APIs
- Math types and coordinate system
- AR-specific APIs (anchors, image tracking, face mesh, cloud anchors)

The file is maintained alongside the source code and updated with every release.

---

## What's in the MCP server

The `@sceneview/mcp` package provides tools that AI assistants can call:

- **`get_api_reference`** — returns the full `llms.txt` content
- **`get_node_reference`** — look up a specific node type's API
- **`get_sample_code`** — get working example code for a use case
- **`get_threading_rules`** — threading and lifecycle rules

### Setup

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sceneview": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sceneview/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible tool.

## Why no other 3D library has this

| Library | AI support |
|---|---|
| **SceneView** | `llms.txt` + MCP server + Claude Code skills |
| Unity | Generic docs, frequent hallucinations on API |
| Sceneform | Archived, AI trained on outdated code |
| Raw ARCore | Low-level API, AI struggles with GL/Vulkan boilerplate |
| Rajawali | Minimal docs, AI has no training data |

SceneView's AI tooling means faster development, fewer bugs, and correct code on the first try. This is a competitive advantage that compounds — the more developers use AI tools, the more SceneView's AI-first approach matters.
