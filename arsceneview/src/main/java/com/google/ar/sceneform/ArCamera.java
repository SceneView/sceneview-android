 * UnsupportedOperationException} when called:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #setParent(NodeParent)} - Camera's parent cannot be changed, it is always the scene.
 *   <li>{@link #setPosition(Float3)} - Camera's position cannot be changed, it is controlled
 *       by the ARCore camera pose.
 *   <li>{@link #setRotation(Float3)} - Camera's rotation cannot be changed, it is
 *       controlled by the ARCore camera pose.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All other functionality in Node is supported. You can access the position and rotation of the
 * camera, assign a collision shape to the camera, or add children to the camera. Disabling the
 * camera turns off rendering.
