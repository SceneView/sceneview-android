/**
 * Represents a virtual camera, which determines the perspective through which the scene is viewed.
 *
 * If the camera is part of an [ARSceneView], then the camera automatically tracks the
 * camera pose from ARCore.
 *
 * The following methods will throw [ ] when called:
 * - [parent] - CameraNode's parent cannot be changed, it is always the scene.
 * - [position] - CameraNode's position cannot be changed, it is controlled by the ARCore camera
 * pose.
 * - [rotation] - CameraNode's rotation cannot be changed, it is controlled by the ARCore camera
 * pose.
 *
 * All other functionality in Node is supported. You can access the position and rotation of the
 * camera, assign a collision shape to the camera, or add children to the camera. Disabling the
 * camera turns off rendering.
