     *
     * - [Point]: Attempt to estimate the normal of the surface centered around the hit test.
     * Surface normal estimation is most likely to succeed on textured surfaces and with camera
     * motion. If [Point.getOrientationMode] returns
     * [Point.OrientationMode.ESTIMATED_SURFACE_NORMAL], then X+ is perpendicular to the cast ray
