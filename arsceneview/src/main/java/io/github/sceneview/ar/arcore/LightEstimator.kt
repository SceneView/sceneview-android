/**
 * ### Per frame AR light estimation
 *
 * ARCore will estimate lighting to provide directional light, ambient spherical harmonics,
 * and reflection cubemap estimation
 *
 * A key part for creating realistic AR experiences is getting the lighting right. When a virtual
 * object is missing a shadow or has a shiny material that doesn't reflect the surrounding space,
 * users can sense that the object doesn't quite fit, even if they can't explain why.
 * This is because humans subconsciously perceive cues regarding how objects are lit in their
 * environment. The Lighting Estimation API analyzes given images for such cues, providing detailed
 * information about the lighting in a scene. You can then use this information when rendering
 * virtual objects to light them under the same conditions as the scene they're placed in,
 * keeping users grounded and engaged.

     * ### ARCore light estimation configuration
     *
     * ARCore estimate lighting to provide directional light, ambient spherical harmonics,
     * and reflection cubemap estimation
     *
     * Light bounces off of surfaces differently depending on whether the surface has specular
     * (highly reflective) or diffuse (not reflective) properties.
     * For example, a metallic ball will be highly specular and reflect its environment, while
     * another ball painted a dull matte gray will be diffuse. Most real-world objects have a
     * combination of these properties â€” think of a scuffed-up bowling ball or a well-used credit
     * card.
     *
     * Reflective surfaces also pick up colors from the ambient environment. The coloring of an
     * object can be directly affected by the coloring of its environment. For example, a white ball
     * in a blue room will take on a bluish hue.
     *
     * The main directional light API calculates the direction and intensity of the scene's
     * main light source. This information allows virtual objects in your scene to show reasonably
     * positioned specular highlights, and to cast shadows in a direction consistent with other
     * visible real objects.

/**
 * ### ARCore light estimation configuration
 *
 * ARCore estimate lighting to provide directional light, ambient spherical harmonics,
 * and reflection cubemap estimation
 *
 * Light bounces off of surfaces differently depending on whether the surface has specular
 * (highly reflective) or diffuse (not reflective) properties.
 * For example, a metallic ball will be highly specular and reflect its environment, while
 * another ball painted a dull matte gray will be diffuse. Most real-world objects have a
 * combination of these properties â€” think of a scuffed-up bowling ball or a well-used credit
 * card.
 *
 * Reflective surfaces also pick up colors from the ambient environment. The coloring of an
 * object can be directly affected by the coloring of its environment. For example, a white ball
 * in a blue room will take on a bluish hue.
 *
 * The main directional light API calculates the direction and intensity of the scene's
 * main light source. This information allows virtual objects in your scene to show reasonably
 * positioned specular highlights, and to cast shadows in a direction consistent with other
 * visible real objects.
