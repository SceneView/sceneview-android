# healthcare-3d-mcp

MCP server for Healthcare & Medical 3D visualization with [SceneView](https://github.com/sceneview/sceneview).

Give Claude (or any MCP-compatible AI assistant) the ability to generate complete, compilable Kotlin code for medical 3D applications on Android using Jetpack Compose and SceneView.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_anatomy_viewer` | 3D anatomy viewer — skeleton, organs, muscles, nervous system, etc. Supports transparency, exploded view, labels, AR mode. |
| `get_molecule_viewer` | Molecular structure viewer — proteins, DNA, RNA, antibodies, viruses. Ball-and-stick, space-filling, ribbon representations. PDB ID support. |
| `get_medical_imaging` | CT/MRI/PET scan 3D visualization. Full DICOM-to-3D pipeline docs. Windowing controls, segmentation overlays, AR mode. |
| `get_surgical_planning` | Surgical planning visualization — measurement, annotation, cross-section, implant placement, pre-op comparison. 8 surgery types. |
| `get_dental_viewer` | Dental scanning visualization — full-arch, implant, orthodontic, CBCT. Root/nerve overlays, treatment stages, shade matching. |
| `list_medical_models` | Database of 20+ free medical 3D models from BodyParts3D, NIH 3D Print Exchange, Sketchfab. With source URLs, licenses, format info. |
| `validate_medical_code` | Validates SceneView medical code for threading, null-safety, API misuse, DICOM requirements, format conversion warnings. |

## Installation

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "healthcare-3d": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "healthcare-3d-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sceneview/sceneview.git
cd sceneview/mcp-healthcare
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage examples

Ask your AI assistant:

- "Build me an anatomy viewer showing the skeletal system with transparency"
- "Create an AR molecule viewer for hemoglobin (PDB: 1HHO) with auto-rotation"
- "Generate a CT scan viewer with windowing controls and segmentation overlay"
- "Build a surgical planning tool for orthopedic surgery with implant placement"
- "Create a dental scan viewer with orthodontic treatment stage timeline"
- "List free 3D models for cardiac anatomy education"

Every tool returns complete, compilable Kotlin code using SceneView 3.5.2 with proper:
- Gradle dependencies
- SceneView composable setup (engine, modelLoader, collisionSystem)
- Null-safe model loading
- LightNode with named `apply` parameter (not trailing lambda)
- Material 3 UI controls
- AR mode with ARCore setup instructions
